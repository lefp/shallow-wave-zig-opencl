# shallow-wave-zig-opencl

Zig version of [shallow-wave](https://github.com/lefp/shallow-wave).

Zig's C interop is good, but I still ended up writing a partial Zig wrapper around OpenCL's C API for convenience and to enforce error-checking. Feel free to copy and extend the wrapper for your own needs.
